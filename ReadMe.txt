# Project 2 - Unconstrained Optimization

This project contains four optimization algorithms implemented in MATLAB:
1. Gradient Descent Method
2. Newton's Method
3. Quasi-Newton Method 
4. Conjugate Gradient Method (Bonus)


## Example Usage:
just run the main.m, and the results will be shown in command window.

The min [x1,x2] value of function3 could be seen in Optimization progress map.
since the Optimization progress map is in 2D, thus only function 3 could be plotted.

## Notice:
Due to space constraints, we have not included additional experimental results for different parameter settings. However, these results can be obtained by modifying and playing with the parameters in the code.

Any more doubts on running this code, please feel free to contact sl5074@g.rit.edu for more information.
